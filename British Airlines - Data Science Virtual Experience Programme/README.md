Welcome to our programme! We are so excited to have you here.

It’s an exciting time to be at British Airways. We’re growing our global route network, investing in our fleet and transforming the experience we offer customers. We are a 24-hour business, operating 365 days of the year, all around the world. It’s a dynamic, fast-paced environment that will bring out the best in you – if you’re ready to embrace responsibility and step up to any challenge. Wherever you join us, you’ll feel proud to play a part in our future as we go further to be the airline of choice. 

During this programme, you will have the opportunity to step into the shoes of a British Airways team member and complete tasks that replicate the work that our Data Science team does every day. You’ll learn how to scrape customer review data and build predictive models.

We hope this programme provides a great resource for you to upskill and strengthen your resume as you explore career options and a potential career at British Airways!
