The KPMG Data Analytics Virtual Internship is designed to help you gain a practical insight into the work we do at KPMG and it is an opportunity for you to build your career skills and experience.

It is not the intention for KPMG to hire students based on their performance in this virtual internship and completing the program is not a pre-requisite when applying for our current vacancies. This virtual internship is an opportunity for you to demonstrate your interest in KPMG and we will consider students favourably who complete the program.

Due to the number of participants potentially completing this program, KPMG will not be able to assess your individual work or provide you with specific feedback. However, after submitting your completed work, you will be able to access model work prepared by our Consultants so you can see how someone from KPMG would approach the task.

If you provide your contact details, KPMG Australia may contact you at any stage to discuss their completed response in more detail.
