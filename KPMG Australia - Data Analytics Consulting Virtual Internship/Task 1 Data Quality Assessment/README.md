“Hi there – Welcome again to the team! The client has asked our team to assess the quality of their data; as well as make recommendations on ways to clean the underlying data and mitigate these issues.  Can you please take a look at the datasets we’ve received and draft an email to them identifying the data quality issues and how this may impact our analysis going forward?

I will send through an example of a typical data quality framework that can be used as a guide. Remember to consider the join keys between the tables too. Thanks again for your help.”

Hi there,

As per voicemail, please find the 3 datasets attached from Sprocket Central Pty Ltd:

Transaction data in the past three months
Can you please review the data quality to ensure that it is ready for our analysis in phase two. Remember to take note of any assumptions or issues we need to go back to the client on. As well as recommendations going forward to mitigate current data quality concerns.

I’ve also attached a data quality framework as a guideline. Let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks for your help.

Kind Regards
Your Manager
